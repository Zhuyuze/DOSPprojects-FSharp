## ConsoleApp1/ TestClient&TestServer uses actor model to finish this task:

Use SHA256 to hash a generated string (with a prefix), and find those with a specified number of prefix 0s in hash results.

Example: "Yuze Zhu !+K` 00000B62288AB8B70D655B51E92B87257C144898C2C10632D62A9CBF677EBC34" is a found one with string "Yuze Zhu !+K`" SHA256 hashed into a result with 5 prefix 0s.

## Gossip makes simulations of message spread among nodes linked in 4 ways:

Full connection, 3D grid connection, line connection, imperfect 3D connection.

## chord makes simulations of a chord ring with finger tables
